Decision Analysis
The field of decision analysis provides framework for making important decisions.
Decision analysis allows us to select a decision from a set of possible decision alternatives when uncertainties regarding the future exist.
The goal is to optimized the resulting payoff in terms of a decision criterion.
Elements of Decision Theory:
1.States of nature: The states of nature could be defined as low demand and high demand.
2.Alternatives: could decide to build a small, medium, or large condominium complex.
3. Payoffs: The profit for each alternative under each potential state of nature is going to be determined.
We develop different models for this problem :
1.Payoff Table Analysis
– Payoff Table analysis can be applied when -
• There is a finite set of discrete decision alternatives.
• The outcome of a decision is a function of a single future event.
– In a Payoff Table -
• The rows correspond to the possible decision alternatives.
• The columns correspond to the possible future events.
• Events (States of Nature) are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.
• The body of the table contains the payoffs.
Payoffs can be expressed in terms of profit, cost, time, distance or any other appropriate measure.
2.Decision Trees
A decision tree is a graphical representation of the decision problem.
Each decision tree has two types of nodes; round nodes correspond to the states of nature while square nodes correspond to the decision alternatives.
The branches leaving each round node represent the different states of nature while the branches leaving each square node represent the different decision alternatives.
At the end of each limb of a tree are the payoffs attained from the series of branches making up that limb.Decision Making Criteria
Classifying Decision Making Criteria
– Decision making under certainty
• The future state of nature is assumed known
– Decision making under risk
• There is some knowledge of the probability of the states of nature occurring.
– Decision making under uncertainty.
• There is no knowledge about the probability of the states of nature occurring.
Decision Making Criteria Under Uncertainty
1.Profit:
1.1.Optimistic (Max of Max )
1.2.Optimistic (Max of Min )
1.3.Optimistic (Min of Max )
2.Cost:
2.1.Optimistic (Min of Min )
2.2.Optimistic (Min of Max )
2.3.Optimistic (Min of Max )
